# Deploy

This course will provide a general introduction to backend engineering and system design, with a focus on scalability.

Each week's material will comprise of a workshop and lab. There will be a diverse array of projects to capture the breadth of the topics that we will cover, as well as a semester-long multi-part project that will be deployed onto the cloud.

## Pre-reqs

This class will primarily use Python, so a strong familiarity with the language is expected. We also suggest familiarity with Git and command line execution.

The course project will be developed using Python, Django, MySQL and Docker and deployed onto AWS. A basic familiarity with HTML and CSS is preferred but not strictly required.

## Course Materials

Syllabus and project assignments will be here in GitHub. Feel free to fork and submit pull requests with corrections, additions or any other changes you think would help fellow / future students.

Course communication will primarily be through Slack. Please ensure you have notifications enabled for our channel - we also suggest downloading Slack's mobile app so you don't miss anything we send out.

## Course Policies and Information

### Attendance

Since we only have 10 workshops over the course of this semester, 2 workshop or 3 lab unexcused absences will result in termination from the course, per the instructor's discretion. If you need to miss one of these for any reason, please communicate with your instructors - we're happy to accomodate.

### Office Hours

There are no formal office hours since labs also act as periods to ask questions. However, we're more than happy to find additional time to go over course content, talk about projects or just grab coffee!

If your question can be handled over Slack, please send us (Chris Santamaria, Harrison Clark and Jedidiah Park) a direct message.
